# STLink Server

## Overview

This project is an open-source reimplementation of the ST-Link server for interfacing with STMicroelectronics ST-Link debug probes. The original closed-source ST-Link server provided by STMicroelectronics has proven unreliable on Windows, particularly on the latest Windows 11 24H2 release. Users frequently encounter issues where the ST-Link probe is not detected, often requiring a reinstallation of the software after every Windows update. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging native Windows APIs (WinUSB, SetupAPI, and Winsock) instead of cross-platform shims, resulting in a more robust and reliable solution.

## Motivation

The closed-source ST-Link server provided by STMicroelectronics suffers from the following issues on Windows 11 24H2:
- **Unreliable Device Detection**: The server often fails to detect ST-Link probes, especially after Windows updates.
- **Frequent Reinstallation Required**: Users must reinstall the server software after nearly every Windows update, disrupting workflows.
- **Cross-Platform Shim Overhead**: The original implementation uses cross-platform abstractions that introduce compatibility issues and inefficiencies on Windows.

This open-source reimplementation resolves these problems by:
- Using **native Windows APIs** (WinUSB for USB communication, SetupAPI for device enumeration, and Winsock for potential network functionality) to ensure compatibility and reliability.
- Implementing robust hotplug detection to handle device arrival and removal seamlessly.
- Providing a command-line interface for testing and debugging ST-Link probes, with commands to blink LEDs, erase flash, read firmware versions, and enter SWD mode.
- Offering an open-source codebase that can be maintained and extended by the community.

## Features

- **Reliable Device Detection**: Consistently detects ST-Link probes using native Windows APIs.
- **Hotplug Support**: Handles device arrival and removal events without requiring software reinstallation.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Supports commands for common ST-Link operations, such as:
  - Blinking the ST-Link LED
  - Erasing target flash memory
  - Retrieving firmware version
  - Entering SWD mode
- **Windows 11 24H2 Compatibility**: Tested and verified to work seamlessly on the latest Windows 11 release.
- **Open-Source**: Licensed under [MIT License](#license) for community contributions and transparency.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Windows 11 (tested on 24H2) or Windows 10.
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio 2022 with C++ Desktop Development workload.
- **Libraries**: The project uses standard Windows libraries (`ws2_32.lib`, `setupapi.lib`, `winusb.lib`), which are included with Visual Studio.
- **Hardware**: An STMicroelectronics ST-Link debug probe (e.g., ST-Link/V2, ST-Link/V3).

### Build Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stlink_server.git
   cd stlink_server
   ```
2. **Open the Solution**:
   - Open `stlink_server.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.
3. **Build the Project**:
   - Select the desired configuration (e.g., `Debug` or `Release`) and platform (`x64` or `x86`).
   - Build the solution (`Build > Build Solution`) to generate the executable.
4. **Run the Executable**:
   - The executable will be located in the `Debug` or `Release` folder (e.g., `x64/Debug/stlink_server.exe`).
   - Ensure your ST-Link probe is connected before running.
   - update the registry location to the updated version
     
 Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\STMicroelectronics\stlink_server\InstallDir]

@="C:\\ST\\stlink_server\\stlinkserver.exe"

## Usage

1. **Run the Server**:
   - Execute the compiled `stlink_server.exe` from the command prompt or PowerShell:
     ```bash
     .\x64\Debug\stlink_server.exe
     ```
   - The server will initialize and attempt to detect the ST-Link probe.

2. **Interact with the Command-Line Interface**:
   - Upon successful initialization, the server displays a menu:
     ```
     STLink Server Commands:
     1. Blink LED
     2. Erase Flash
     3. Get Firmware Version
     4. Enter SWD Mode
     5. Exit
     Enter choice (1-5):
     ```
   - Enter a number (1â€“5) to execute the corresponding command.
   - Example: Enter `1` to blink the ST-Link LED, or `3` to retrieve the firmware version.

3. **Hotplug Support**:
   - The server automatically detects ST-Link probe connections and disconnections, logging events to the console.
   - No reinstallation is required after Windows updates or device reconnections.  
   - you can manually run it in debug mode to check if its detecting the STLINK
     
    stlinkserver.exe --debug 5
